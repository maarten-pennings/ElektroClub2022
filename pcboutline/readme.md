# PCB outline


The design of the big "2022" digits is made in [Visio](outline.vsdx).
This drawing includes the board outline (with the slots) from the 3D model.

The drawing includes the outline (red) and the digits (black).
I did two separate exports, the red lines to a [DXF file](outline.dxf)
and the black/gray digits to a [png file](letters.png).

The PCB tool needs these formats.
